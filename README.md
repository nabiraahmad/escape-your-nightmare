## Description
This 2D horror-survival game, crafted entirely from scratch using **C++** and the **SDL library**, takes players in the eerie journey of a young girl who believes she's trapped within a dream. Armed with a flickering candle and a rocket launcher, she navigates a creepy forest dungeon haunted by skeletons following her. Her objective: to locate her bed and awaken from this nightmare!

Once she reaches her bed, the nightmare isn't over. Now in an abandoned hospital, she's attacked by witch doctors. It's harder to escape this one: her movements are sluggish, her ammunition scarce, and her enemies require more firepower to defeat.

Once she reaches her bed again, the young girl confronts the ultimate level: the 'big boss battle.' Here, in a claustrophobic arena, her enemies grow larger, swifter, and more resilient.

_Currently, I'm enhancing the game with several improvements. I'm modifying shaders to create very limited lighting that follows the young girl. I plan to update the final level by creating a new map and adding more enemies. I also intend to add a cooldown mechanic between shots fired from her gun to increase difficulty_
